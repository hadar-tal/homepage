Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/) at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 
studying under the supervision of [Dr. Oron Sabag](https://sites.google.com/view/oronsabag/).  
My journey has taken me into academic research, after earlier work on high-scale engineering challenges.

My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, learning, and decision-making, including:  
- **Online Decision Making**   
- **Reinforcement Learning**   
- **Deep Learning**  

Iâ€™m always eager to explore new ideas, collaborate, and dive deep into the fascinating world of AI and optimization. Feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
