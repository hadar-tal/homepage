👋 **Hello there!**  

I’m a **Master’s student** in Computer Science at **The Hebrew University of Jerusalem**, studying under the supervision of [Dr. Oron Sabag](https://sites.google.com/view/oronsabag/home?authuser=0). 
My journey has taken me into academic research, after earlier work on high-scale engineering challenges.

🔬 My research interests lie at the intersection of **mathematics, learning, and decision-making**, including:  
- **Reinforcement Learning** 🤖  
- **Online Decision Making** ⏳  
- **Markov Decision Processes** 🔄  
- **Deep Learning** 🧠  

I’m always eager to explore new ideas, collaborate, and dive deep into the fascinating world of AI and optimization. Feel free to reach out! 🚀
