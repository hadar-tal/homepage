I mentor a group of students on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) project as part of the Engineering Project and Workshops course. 
The course is designed for fourth-year students and focuses on practical, research-oriented work.

## Responsibilities
* **Mentoring students in RL and DRL methodologies** – guiding them through fundamental concepts, policy optimization, and neural network-based function approximation.  
* **Supervising the development of RL-based projects** – assisting in implementing algorithms like Deep Q-Learning (DQN), PPO, and actor-critic methods.  
* **Providing insights on theoretical and practical aspects** – ensuring students understand exploration strategies and evaluation metrics in DRL.
